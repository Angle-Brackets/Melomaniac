## P0 — Core Engine (MVP)

### Tauri v2 Workspace
- [x] Initialise Tauri v2 project with Vite + React + TypeScript frontend
- [x] Upgrade all Tauri packages from RC to stable v2 (tauri 2.10.3, tauri-build 2.5.6, tauri-plugin-shell 2.3.5, @tauri-apps/cli/api 2.10.1)
- [x] Upgrade frontend toolchain (Vite 5→6, @vitejs/plugin-react 4→5, Swiper 11→12, 0 audit vulnerabilities)
- [x] Gitignore generated targets: `src-tauri/gen/apple`, `src-tauri/gen/android`, `src-tauri/gen/schemas`, `src-tauri/target`
- [x] Configure workspace for iOS and Android compilation targets (requires Xcode — fixed version mismatch for Xcode 15.4)
- [x] Verify a "Hello World" build runs on Desktop [x], iOS simulator [x], iOS real device [x] — Android emulator pending
- [ ] Set up project directory structure (`.melomaniac/objects/`, `src/`, `src-tauri/`)

### Native Audio Bridge ⚠️ (Highest Risk — Do First)
- [x] Set up `crates/audio` workspace crate (`melomaniac-audio`) inside `src-tauri/`
- [x] Define `AudioBridge` trait, `AudioSource` (`File` + uninhabitable `Stream` stub), `TrackMetadata`, `AudioEvent`, and `AudioError` in `crates/audio/src/lib.rs`
- [x] Implement desktop backend (`crates/audio/src/desktop.rs`) — dedicated audio thread, `MixerDeviceSink` + `Player` (rodio 0.22 API), `symphonia-all` codecs, atomic position tracking, volume persistence across loads
- [x] Wire `AudioState` into Tauri managed state; implement all seven Tauri commands in `src/audio.rs` (`audio_load`, `audio_play`, `audio_pause`, `audio_stop`, `audio_seek`, `audio_set_volume`, `audio_position`)
- [x] Spawn event-forwarding thread: `AudioEvent` → `AppHandle::emit("audio://event")` → frontend
- [x] Create stub `IosBridge` and update `lib.rs` feature flags to enable iOS compilation
- [x] Implement AVAudioPlayer bridge for iOS background audio — Swift FFI via `@_cdecl`, `swift-rs` SPM package at `crates/audio/ios/`; `IosBridge` in `crates/audio/src/ios.rs`; `UIBackgroundModes: audio` in `src-tauri/Info.ios.plist`
- [x] Verify background audio persistence when app is minimised on iOS (confirmed on device)
- [x] Implement lockscreen/Control Centre Now Playing widget — `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` updated every 250 ms + immediately on play; `MPRemoteCommandCenter` (play, pause, next, prev, toggle) with token retention; `RemotePlay/RemotePause/RemoteNextTrack/RemotePreviousTrack/RemoteTogglePlayPause` variants added to `AudioEvent`
- [ ] Verify Now Playing widget appears on real device (simulator cannot show it — test when device controls are wired)
- [ ] Implement ExoPlayer / Media3 bridge for Android background audio
- [ ] Verify background audio persistence when app is minimised on Android
- [ ] Implement lockscreen controls (play, pause, skip) on Android
- [x] Expose `play`, `pause`, `seek`, `stop`, `audio_load`, `audio_set_volume`, `audio_position` Tauri commands to frontend

### yt-dlp Ingestion Wrapper
- [ ] Implement `std::process::Command` wrapper around `yt-dlp` binary
- [ ] Support audio-only download with format selection (FLAC/MP3)
- [ ] Implement error handling for failed or changed yt-dlp formats
- [ ] Bundle or document yt-dlp binary update strategy for end users
- [ ] Expose ingest command to frontend via Tauri invoke

### Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) Model
- [x] Implement `blake3` file hashing for ingested audio and image files (`crates/storage/src/cas.rs` — `CasStore::hash`)
- [x] Implement blob storage to `<app_data_dir>/objects/<xx>/<remaining-62>` with atomic write (`CasStore::write_blob`)
- [x] Implement deduplication check before writing a new blob (exists check in `write_blob`)
- [x] Define JSON Tree (playlist) manifest schema (`{ "tracks": [{ "hash", "ab_start_ms", "ab_end_ms" }] }` — committed as CAS blob via `branch_commit`)
- [x] Define and implement JSON Commit schema (tree_hash, parent, timestamp, device_id, message — `CommitRecord`)
- [x] Implement Commit read/write functions (`db.insert_commit`, `db.get_commit`, `db.get_commit_history`)
- [x] Set up SQLite database with `sqlx` (`crates/storage/src/db.rs` — WAL mode, foreign keys, migrations)
- [x] Implement SQLite schema for track metadata, plays/skips, playlists, branches, commits, commit_parents (migrations 0001–0004)
- [x] Implement indexer that reconciles SQLite against CAS on startup (`crates/storage/src/indexer.rs` — removes stale rows, logs orphan blobs)
- [x] Wire `StorageState` into Tauri app (`src-tauri/src/storage.rs` + `lib.rs`); expose 7 commands: `library_get_all`, `library_set_favorite`, `playlist_get_all`, `playlist_create`, `playlist_fork`, `branch_create`, `branch_commit`
- [x] Write integration tests for CAS, DB, and Indexer (18/18 passing)

### Axum Self-Hosted Sync Server
- [ ] Scaffold Axum server project inside workspace
- [ ] Implement `/status` endpoint
- [ ] Implement `/pull` endpoint (serve missing commits/trees/blobs to client)
- [ ] Implement `/push` endpoint (receive commits/trees/blobs from client)
- [ ] Dockerize server with a minimal `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] Document self-hosting setup in README

### React Frontend Scaffolding
- [x] Set up Zustand store with slices for queue, playback state, library, and playlist (`src/store/`)
  - `playbackSlice` — `isPlaying`, `loadedTrackHash`, `duration_ms`, `volume`; `position_ms` intentionally excluded (lives in `useRef` for rAF loop)
  - `queueSlice` — `queueTracks`, `currentIndex`, `ShuffleMode` (`Off`/`Random`/`Smart`), `RepeatMode` (`None`/`One`/`All`), `shuffledQueue` lookahead (default 20), `shuffleHistory` dedup; `Smart` uses Fisher-Yates permutation, `Random` samples with history dedup
  - `librarySlice` — `TrackMeta[]` with `favorited: boolean`; `toggleFavorite` uses optimistic update with rollback; stubs `library_get_all` / `library_set_favorite` Tauri commands
  - `playlistSlice` — `playlists: PlaylistMeta[]`, `currentCommitHash`; no-op until CAS/Commit layer is built
- [ ] Implement `requestAnimationFrame` progress bar loop via `useRef` (no React re-renders)
- [ ] Implement virtualized tracklist with `tanstack/react-virtual` (target: 10,000+ tracks)
- [ ] Build player controls UI (play, pause, seek, skip, volume)
- [ ] Build library view wired to SQLite metadata via Tauri invoke
- [ ] Build basic playlist view rendering Tree manifest tracks
- [x] Verify end-to-end audio playback on Desktop and iOS real device — `debug_play_test_track` async Tauri command (`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`) embeds `tests/audio/test.mp3` via `include_bytes!`, writes to CAS, loads + plays via `spawn_blocking`; called from `App.tsx` (DEV only, 5 s delay)
- [ ] Wire `MusicControls` buttons to audio invoke commands (play, pause, seek, volume)
- [ ] Wire yt-dlp ingest UI (URL input → download → library refresh)
